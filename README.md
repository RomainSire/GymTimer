# GymTimer
A timer to follow your own serie of exercices  
Designed for isometric exercices (core strength)  

## Operation
You can add as much exercices as you want, and its execution time.  
You can delete an exercice, if wanted.  
The serie of exercice can be saved. To keep it simple it will be stored as JSON in the browser's LocalStorage.  
When the series of exercice is started, several timers (timeouts and intervales) are triggered to display a countdown for each exercice. It also displays the next exercice to perform to get ready !

## Possible improvements
May be add a 5 seconds rest time between each exercice..
